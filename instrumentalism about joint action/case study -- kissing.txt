Case Study -- Kissing
===========================

Ayesha and Beatrice kiss each other.  Neither of them quite knew what was happening until it had already happened, and neither of them could say why they did it.

In this example none of the necessary conditions for shared intention are met either before or during the kissing (although they may be met afterwards):

- A & B don't know what they were doing
- A & B don't have a conception of themselves as contributing to a collaborative action
- A & B are not aware of each other's intentions (this is part of what makes it so nerve-wracking)

Why think that this is a joint action at all?  It involves an emotionally charged common effect and the agents are not acting alone.
