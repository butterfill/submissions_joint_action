Pluralism about joint action: Making room for imagination and emotion?


Philosophical accounts of joint action have started from the premise that all joint actions involve shared intention, and that the constitutive and normative features of joint action are to be explained by appeal to shared intention.  This premise constrains the roles that imagination and emotion could play in joint action.  But there are empirical and philosophical grounds for doubting the premise.  Such doubts motivate pluralism about joint action, the view that no single substantive account of joint action applies to every case.  If (as argued) there are significant kinds of joint action which do not necessarily involve shared intentions, then understanding constitutive and normative features of some kinds of joint action may require identifying roles for imagination or emotion.

OUTLINE



How to characterise joint action in a way that is consistent with the V.I. hypothesis?  One possibility is shared goals ... another is imagination.

From quite early on children imagine that their toys do things and feel things. They are familiar with imaginary subjects.  And not only this, they often know what they have to do to get the imaginary subjects to behave appropriately.  So they can deduce their role from ascriptions of emotion and action to imaginary subjects.

These capacities are sufficient for one form of joint action.  It's standard to assume that joint action involves shared intentions and that shared intentions involve awareness of oneself as engaged in a collective activity (Lutz) with others ...

Alternative possibility is that joint action is based around the construction of an imaginary subject.  Each of us imagines a 'we', a single agent composed of me and you.  We each attribute intentions to this 'we' subject (hopefully the same intentions---although in many cases this may be a matter of luck) and we each identify our parts in getting those intentions fulfilled (hopefully complementary and jointly sufficient parts---although again in many cases whether this is so may depend more on luck than judgement).  If we succeed in carrying through the imaginary actions, we have performed a joint action.  But we did not necessarily have a shared intention---for we need not have ascribed intentions to each other, or have regarded ourselves as engaging in a collaborative activity.
