Assumptions about shared intention

*see also assumptions about joint action


[1]  account of shared intention must capture some kind of sharedness: "captures “sharedness” or “collectivity” in any sense distinct from what we can construe in terms of standard individualistic theory of action. " \citep[p. 141]{petersson_collectivity_2007}

[2] there must be a distinction between a shared intention and a set of individual noncooperative intentions: " if the characterization of a shared intention allows the individual intentions that make it up to be directed towards a mere set of actions that happen to be grouped together in a purely behavioral sense, the distinction between a shared intention and a set of individual noncooperative intentions will be undermined." \citep[p. 141]{petersson_collectivity_2007}

[3] "shared intentions are supposed to be what ties members together in a collective unit," \citep[p. 141]{petersson_collectivity_2007}

On the purpose of accounts of shared intentions: "the main theoretical purpose of the analyses at hand is to establish a substantial distinction between collective actions and noncollective sets of individual actions." \citep[p. 146]{petersson_collectivity_2007}
