1. YOU
'you task representations': I represent your task
action prediction: I predict your action, the what, where and when of it.
representations of your task measured by inhibition (Frischen et al; slower after another person makes an error)

2. WE
Richardson effect: existence of OUR AFFORDANCE (as contrasted with you affordance, e.g. Veronica on whether other people can jump high enough to reach it)
Groop effect: representation of OUR OUTCOME/ACTION
[We prediction: our what, our where (e.g. the location of the hoop in a joint plum-picking with long heavy stick episode), when (e.g. the when of the turning in Guenther's target tracking)]  [Robrecht pole experiment: prediction of OUR timing & OUR location (of pole). HAPTIC]

Entrainment goes in the music box

Theme: all studies show more about perception-action links

What is currently known about ...

1. planning processes: 
1a. Planning processes in joint action; YOU-planning, WE-planning
2b. Effects of spatial and social relations
2c. Effects of context [imitate/complement] on planning processes
-- context [imitate/complement] modulates how hard it is to plan an action
-- YOU representations: Shared task representations in multiple paradigms (ยง3.4.1), i.e. how you represent another's task ([a] boundary conditions---including seeing each other, space, social relation, social context e.g. competitive vs cooperative, intentionality of co-actor; [b] neural basis); 
-- WE representations: GROOP effect; 

2. coordination mechanisms:
a. predictions about the timing of others' actions 
b. entrainment (Tognoli et al)
c.
