Hi Stephen,

I think Brian's comments are nicely converging with your earlier ones. Therefore, I was wondering whether I could persuade you to take the lead in the revision of the chapter.

Would you be able to provide a first draft of the revision addressing the two points below? Both issues require zooming out and I have often felt that being close to the data makes zooming out quite hard.

Time is short, I would need your draft by 5th September. Please feel free to say no if this is hard to reconcile with your other duties.

Cheers,
Guenther

1) Second, I think it would help a lot if you added in short summaries at end of sections, especially long ones, so the reader can understand the main points you want them to derive from the section. You often mention a few different points in a section and by the end I was not sure what to take away – a sentence or two or three would help.   I do want to be clear that the overall message, as outlined in your Discussion (section 4) did come across during the reading, but I would have been hard-pressed to put together the arguments you made during the chapter.  (I admit that could partly be me and that I read 4 chapters for this volume this week, but I think at least some of it is the chapter – feel free to get another person’s perspective on this too.)

2) I usually have a section were I make picky comments about typos etc., but I found no typos (I don’t look for them ever but they often jump out).  I think this is only the third time I have written this in the large number of volumes I have done.  I did want to make two comments about the first and last sections.  The introduction was very interesting and made the issues and plan clear.  I thought the final discussion section was very stimulating – brought up lots of issues.  Do feel free to expand if you wish (though you don’t need to – I just want to offer it in case you had wanted to but did not due to space).
