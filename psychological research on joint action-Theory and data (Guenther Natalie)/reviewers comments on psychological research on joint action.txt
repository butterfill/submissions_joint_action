Dear Brian,

Thanks for your feedback. If only all reviews would be as nice and constructive as yours... We are very happy that you liked the chapter and we will revise it along the lines you suggested. 

Best wishes,
Guenther

To someone with my background (I knew only a few of these and did not have the organization clear), it was an eye-opening journey.

Your helpful repetition of the big subsections (e.g., entrainment) also lead the reader (or at least this reader) to be unsure what section I was in and how it fit.  Two things will help in the book, one of which will be done and one of which I would suggest.  First, there will be a Table of Contents that will go at least two levels down so the reader can better see the overall organization.  (The front Table usually just goes one level 1, 2,…, but the one in front of each chapter is usually two levels, 1, 1.1, 1.2…)  Second, I think it would help a lot if you added in short summaries at end of sections, especially long ones, so the reader can understand the main points you want them to derive from the section. You often mention a few different points in a section and by the end I was not sure what to take away – a sentence or two or three would help.   I do want to be clear that the overall message, as outlined in your Discussion (section 4) did come across during the reading, but I would have been hard-pressed to put together the arguments you made during the chapter.  (I admit that could partly be me and that I read 4 chapters for this volume this week, but I think at least some of it is the chapter – feel free to get another person’s perspective on this too.)

Even so, I usually ask authors to make the chapter readable for all, in the hope that it will have greater impact.  For a chapter such as yours, I feel this even more strongly than usual—there is a great deal of literature and your organization that I think many researchers outside of your main area will find of interest so do try to make it clearer to them. This is an area of much current interest and even those of us outside of it (like me) realize that it may have implications for our work as well as the integration of basic processes that you point out in your discussion.

> Let me add two formatting issues.  First, we need an abstract.  Second, I see you are using the formatting style I asked you to but all headings need to be done this way (e.g., Entrainment on page 6 should be 2.1.1).  I think this will make the structure even more clear plus they will do it if you do not and you are less likely to make a mistake.  In addition, in some long sections, you might consider some further subheadings – as one example on page 29 when you move to brain measures in the first section of 3.4 (which is quite a few pages long).

I think this is only the third time I have written this in the large number of volumes I have done.  I did want to make two comments about the first and last sections.  The introduction was very interesting and made the issues and plan clear.  I thought the final discussion section was very stimulating – brought up lots of issues.  Do feel free to expand if you wish (though you don’t need to – I just want to offer it in case you had wanted to but did not due to space).

This chapter was in great shape so even with the annoying changes I recommended (and they are suggestions—I am willing to publish this as is if you don’t want to take my suggestions), I don’t think you have much work here.
