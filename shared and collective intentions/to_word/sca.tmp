<!--l. 36--><text:p text:style-name="Text-body">A joint action is a goal-directed action, or something resembling one, comprising two or
more agents&#x2019; goal-directed activities. What is the relation between a joint action and
the goal (or goals) to which it is directed? Answering this question is necessary for
saying what joint actions are and for understanding in what senses, if any, they are
actions.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 42--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   To illustrate, suppose Ayesha and Beatrice between them lift a table thereby
releasing a cat whose paws were trapped and, simultaneously, breaking a glass. On
standard theories of events, the event which initiated the cat&#x2019;s release is identical to the
event which initiated the glass&#x2019; destruction (<t4htlink 
href="#XDavidson:1969ie">Davidson</t4htlink><text:s/><t4htlink 
href="#XDavidson:1969ie">1969</t4htlink>). But observing this joint
action we might wonder whether its goal was the release of the cat or the destruction of
the glass (or both); and if we are in doubt about this then in an important sense
we don&#x2019;t yet know which action Ayesha and Beatrice performed. To identify
their action we need not only a concrete event, something with temporal and
spatial properties, but also an abstract outcome such as that of the cat&#x2019;s release
(<t4htlink 
href="#XDavidson:1971fz">Davidson</t4htlink><text:s/><t4htlink 
href="#XDavidson:1971fz">1971</t4htlink>).
</text:p> 
<!--l. 44--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Ayesha, asked about the table lifting episode, might insist, &#x2018;The goal of our
intervention wasn&#x2019;t to smash the glass but to free the cat.&#x2019; (Note that this statement
concerns the goal of an action and does not explicitly mention the agents&#x2019; intention.)
Applied to this example, the question can be put like this. What is it for the goal of
Ayesha and Beatrice&#x2019;s action to be that of releasing the cat rather than that of breaking
the glass?
</text:p> 
<!--l. 46--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The term &#x2018;goal&#x2019; has been used for outcomes, whether possible or actual, as in
phrases like &#x2018;the goal of our struggles&#x2019;. The same term has also been used, perhaps
improperly, for psychological states; it is in this second sense that agents&#x2019; goals might
cause their actions. In this paper the term &#x2018;goal&#x2019; is used in the former sense only,
and the terms &#x2018;goal-outcome&#x2019; and &#x2018;goal-state&#x2019; are occasionally used to stress
the distinction. Our question is about how joint actions are related to their
goal-outcomes.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 48--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The term &#x2018;joint action&#x2019; also needs clarification. This term might be used in different
ways, much as the term &#x2018;action&#x2019; sometimes encompasses habitual actions or motor
behaviours but in other cases is used more narrowly to refer to intentional
actions only. Sometimes &#x2018;joint action&#x2019; and related terms are used intuitively. One
difficulty with relying exclusively on intuition is that different people seem to
have incompatible intuitions about which events are joint actions. We can
mitigate this difficulty with a stipulation. We are presently interested in how
actions relate to goals and, specifically, in the possibility that the involvement of
multiple agents complicates a true account of this relation. Accordingly we
stipulate a sufficient condition for joint action. For multiple agents&#x2019; purposive
activities to constitute a joint action it is sufficient that there is a single goal to
                                                                                

                                                                                
which these activities are directed where this is not, or not only, a matter of
each agent&#x2019;s activities individually being directed to that goal. (We return to
consider whether this condition is really sufficient for joint action in section<text:s/><t4htlink 
href="#x1-60006">6<!--tex4ht:ref: section_objection --></t4htlink> on
page<text:s/><t4htlink 
href="#x1-60006">17</t4htlink>.)
</text:p> 
<!--l. 55--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   So how are joint actions related to their goal-outcomes? For individual (that is, not
joint) action, the counterpart of this question has a standard answer. In barest outline,
an individual action consists in an agent acting on an intention (a goal-state). The
intention has a content which specifies an outcome. This outcome is a goal of the action.
It is a goal of the action in virtue of being specified by an intention the agent is acting
on.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 62--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   How do things stand in the case of joint action? Can we extend the standard answer
from individual to joint action?
</text:p> 
<!--l. 64--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The usual way of thinking about joint action starts with the premise that all
significant cases of joint action involve shared intention. This is taken for granted by

<!--l. 76--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   But what is shared intention? In barest outline, shared intentions are supposed to do
for multiple agents some of what ordinary intentions do for individuals. So, like an
ordinary intention, a shared intention coordinates plans and activities&#x2014;with the
difference that these are the plans and activities of multiple agents performing a joint
action (<t4htlink 
href="#XBratman:1993je">Bratman</t4htlink><text:s/><t4htlink 
href="#XBratman:1993je">1993</t4htlink>).
</text:p> 
<!--l. 80--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Notions of shared intention provide a straightforward way to extend the standard
theory about the relation between individual actions and their goal-outcomes to the
case of joint action. Given a notion of shared intention and an account of what it is
for agents to act on a shared intention, the standard theory is extended by
                                                                                

                                                                                
substituting shared for individual intentions. The shared intention specifies an
outcome. This outcome is a goal to which the joint action is directed in virtue of
being the outcome specified by a shared intention on which the agents are
acting.

<!--l. 96--><text:p text:style-name="Text-body">Why investigate the possibility of relations between joint actions and their goals which
involve nothing like shared intention?
</text:p> 
<!--l. 98--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   In focussing on shared intention the philosophers&#x2019; approaches to joint action stand in
stark contrast to psychological research on how joint action is possible. To illustrate,
Schmidt and colleagues assert in passing that &#x2018;many joint actions occur spontaneously
or automatically without the participants being consciously aware of their
coordination with each other&#x2019; (<t4htlink 
href="#Xschmidt_understanding_2010">2010</t4htlink>, p. 7). Similarly, Vesper and colleagues, in
offering a &#x2018;minimal architecture&#x2019; for joint action, are able to take for granted
that shared intention is a feature only of sophisticated forms of joint action
(<t4htlink 
href="#Xvesper_minimal_2010">Vesper et<text:s/>al.</t4htlink><text:s/><t4htlink 
href="#Xvesper_minimal_2010">2010</t4htlink>). This view is implicit in a range of scientific research about
joint action in which shared intention plays no role (as reviewed in<text:s/><t4htlink 
href="#XKnoblich:2010fk">Knoblich
et<text:s/>al.</t4htlink><text:s/><t4htlink 
href="#XKnoblich:2010fk">2010</t4htlink>;<text:s/><t4htlink 
href="#XSebanz:2006yq">Sebanz et<text:s/>al.</t4htlink><text:s/><t4htlink 
href="#XSebanz:2006yq">2006</t4htlink>). This research focuses on mechanisms coordinating
activities including entrainment, motor emulation and task co-representation. While it is
sometimes acknowledged that shared intention could also play a role in coordinating
some joint actions (e.g.<text:s/><t4htlink 
href="#XKnoblich:2008hy">Knoblich &#x0026; Sebanz</t4htlink><text:s/><t4htlink 
href="#XKnoblich:2008hy">2008</t4htlink>), this is never held to be
essential.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 109--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   On the surface claims that there are joint actions without shared intentions are puzzling.
The puzzle is not that, as we have seen, some philosophers stipulate that joint action
involves shared intention; this might be incorrect or only terminological. Rather, the puzzle
is this. It agreed on all sides that the joint actions of interest are, or resemble, goal-directed
actions.<t4htlink

In particular, it is agreed that for several agents&#x2019; activities to constitute a joint action
there must be a goal to which these activities taken together are directed. And,
trivial cases aside, their activities being directed to this goal cannot consist
                                                                                

                                                                                
entirely in each agent&#x2019;s activities being individually directed to the goal. The
puzzle is to understand how two or more agents&#x2019; activities could be collectively
directed to a goal without the agents sharing an intention. We need to solve
this puzzle in order to properly understand the claim that some joint actions
do not involve anything like shared intention. This puzzle is what motivates
investigating relations between joint actions and their goals not involving shared
intention.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 127--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   A surprisingly common response to the puzzle is to insist that it has no bearing on
philosophical questions about joint action on the grounds that the psychologists are not
investigating joint action in the philosophers&#x2019; sense and that their research is not
relevant to philosophical issues concerning joint action. While it is probably true that
the term &#x2018;joint action&#x2019; is used in a variety of senses (even between narrowly
philosophical discussions), there are several reasons to reject this response. One is that,
contrary to what is often assumed, philosophers invoke several notions of joint action
and have raised a variety of questions about them (contrast <t4htlink

href="#Xtuomela_we-intentions_2005">2005</t4htlink>). There is no
reason to assume that all of these notions and questions must be unrelated to
psychological discoveries. There is also a form of interdependence between the
philosophical and scientific research. The scientific research is often aimed at
understanding forms of joint action including the most sophisticated as characterised
by philosophers. Conversely, the philosophical research is usually aimed at
characterising forms of joint action that are in some way important to ordinary humans
(e.g.<text:s/><t4htlink 
href="#XBratman:1992mi">Bratman</t4htlink><text:s/><t4htlink 
href="#XBratman:1992mi">1992</t4htlink>, p.<text:s/>327), which means that accounts of what joint action is
need to be anchored in empirical phenomena. To illustrate, it is relatively
uncontroversial that shared intentions play a role in coordinating agents&#x2019; activities. As
mentioned above, several other mechanisms are also involved in coordinating
agents&#x2019; activities. It is unlikely that shared intentions can be fully understood if
treated in isolation from other factors responsible for coordination (the same
is probably true for ordinary, non-shared intentions and other factors in the
control of non-joint action). Instead we need to understand how the several
sources of coordination in joint action combine in making effective joint action
possible. This is not to deny that joint action can usefully studied by philosophers
in isolation. Our claim is only that fully understanding both what it is and
how it happens will involve correctly interpreting current and future empirical
discoveries.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 147--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Difficulties in grasping the relevance of psychological to philosophical research on
joint action (and conversely) reflect deficiencies in understanding the phenomena.
Removing these difficulties requires analysing forms of joint action without shared
intention.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 150--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   There is also non-scientific motivation for investigating how joint actions might be
                                                                                

                                                                                
related to their goals other than by shared intention. Petersson offers an a
priori argument for the possibility of joint action without shared intention
(<t4htlink 
href="#Xpetersson_collectivity_2007">Petersson</t4htlink><text:s/><t4htlink 
href="#Xpetersson_collectivity_2007">2007</t4htlink>), but his argument concerns only forms of activity so primitive that
they require agency it at most a highly attenuated sense. It is perhaps an interesting
question in its own right whether we can make sense of the possibility that
there are richer forms of joint action without shared intention. Answering this
question may be relevant to understanding the distinctive value of joint actions
involving shared intention. Further, it is a plausible assumption that characterising
joint action involving shared intention will require appeal to forms of joint
action not involving shared intention. In a groundbreaking study, Searle (<t4htlink 
href="#XSearle:1990em">1990</t4htlink>)
notes that shared intentions must be about an activity which in fact involves
multiple agents but cannot, on pain of circularity or violation of constraints on
well-foundedness, be characterised in ways that presuppose shared intention. This
suggests that some shared intentions will involve contents that pick out actions
potentially involving multiple agents but not involving shared intentions. This does
not require the existence of joint actions without shared intentions, but it
does require descriptions of what are in fact joint actions without reference to
shared intention. Consequently it is possible that analysing joint action without
shared intention will support claims concerning what shared intentions are
about.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 160--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   We have seen that there are several reasons why an explanation of how joint actions
relate to their goals not involving shared intention is needed. That such an explanation
is needed does not entail that an explanation involving shared intention is incorrect. For
all that we have said here, different joint actions may be related to their goals in
different ways. Returning briefly to the case of individual action for comparison, there
are accounts of the relation between actions and their goals not involving intentions or
goal-states of any kind (e.g. <t4htlink

intention or about the standard theory. Rather, the motivating claim is sometimes
that, while many goal-directed actions do involve intentions, there are also
goal-directed actions not involving intentions. If this were correct it would arguably be
necessary to develop multiple approaches to characterising the relation between
individual actions and their goals, some involving intentions and some not involving
intentions. Independently of whether or not this is correct in the individual case,
something similar may be true in the case of joint action. For this reason we
do not claim that accounts of the relation between joint actions and their
goals are incorrect. Our claim is just that such accounts are either incorrect or
incomplete.

<!--l. 188--><text:p text:style-name="Text-body">How can we explain the relation between some joint actions and their goals without
invoking shared intentions? In this section we take a first step; the question is answered
in the next section.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 190--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   In many (perhaps all) cases of joint action there is a single outcome to which each
agent&#x2019;s activities are individually directed such that the following is possible: all of the
agents&#x2019; activities succeed. Let a <text:span text:style-name="Emphasis" ><text:span 
text:style-name="cmti-12">distributive goal</text:span></text:span> of a joint action, or of a collection
of goal-directed activities, be any such outcome. To illustrate, suppose that
many revellers at a village festival jump into a single boat each with the aim of
sinking it, where each reveller&#x2019;s aim would be met if the boat were to sink
under their collective weight. That the boat sink is a distributive goal of their
activities.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 195--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The notion of a distributive goal is not by itself enough to explain how joint
actions relate to their goals. It is only one ingredient in the explanation we
offer (see section<text:s/><t4htlink 
href="#x1-40004">4<!--tex4ht:ref: section_collective --></t4htlink> on page<text:s/><t4htlink 
href="#x1-40004">12</t4htlink>). The rest of this section highlights features of
distributive goals which are straightforward but have sometimes occasioned
misunderstanding.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 199--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Where agents act on a shared intention, their activities often or always (depending
on what shared intentions are) have a distributive goal. But the notion of a distributive
goal is much broader; in many cases there are distributive goals but no shared intention.
Winfred works in the library of an embassy currently under attack. He is setting fire to
papers with the intention of destroying all the secret documents before they can be
captured. With all the smoke and noise of the attack Winfred has no idea
whether he is working alone or whether colleagues are acting on the same
goal, nor does he have time to reflect on this. It happens that several of his
colleagues have had the same idea and are destroying documents nearby with
the same goal as Winfred. In this case there is no shared intention because
none of the agents are aware of any of the others and none know that they
are not acting alone. In fact Winfred and his colleagues&#x2019; activities arguably
do not constitute a joint action. But their activities do have a distributive
goal.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 210--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Note that multiple agents&#x2019; activities do not have a distributive goal just in virtue of
the agents&#x2019; actions being directed to similar outcomes or to outcomes of the
same type. In an example from Searle (<t4htlink 
href="#XSearle:1990em">1990</t4htlink>, p.<text:s/>92), rain causes park visitors
simultaneously to take cover under a central shelter. Suppose that each visitor&#x2019;s activity
is directed to a similar but distinct outcome, namely her own arrival at the
                                                                                

                                                                                
shelter. This is not sufficient for the visitors&#x2019; activities to have a distributive
goal.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 212--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The notion of a distributive goal has applications in observation of action where
observers have limited knowledge of the agents&#x2019; mental states. In everyday life many
people readily assign goals to the activities of pluralities. Tyrone and Anne are looking
out of the window in a city to whose customs they are both strangers. Anne asks what
<text:span text:style-name="Emphasis" ><text:span 
text:style-name="cmti-12">those people</text:span></text:span> with the brushes are doing and Tyrone replies by saying that <text:span text:style-name="Emphasis" ><text:span 
text:style-name="cmti-12">they</text:span></text:span> are
clearing the street of glass. Tyrone&#x2019;s reply is naturally interpreted as identifying a
distributive goal of their activities rather than (say) the contents of any agents&#x2019;
intentions. On this interpretation, the plural prediction involves almost no
commitments beyond those that would be incurred by talking about each agent
individually.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 218--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   As specified in the above definition, for two or more agents&#x2019; activities to have a
distributive goal the relation between each agent&#x2019;s activities and the goal must be such
that it is possible for all agents&#x2019; activities to succeed relative to this goal. To
illustrate, take Sam and Marnie who are among the revellers at the village festival
mentioned above. There is a boat which Sam and Marnie each individually intend
to sink. Arguably there are two ways of further specifying this situation. It
may be that Sam&#x2019;s and Marine&#x2019;s intentions are incompatible in the sense that
they cannot both be realised; each would have to be the sole sinker of this
particular boat to succeed. Alternatively, it may be that Sam&#x2019;s and Marnie&#x2019;s
intentions are compatible in the sense that it is possible for both to be be
fulfilled; they could both succeed by sinking the boat together. Only in the
latter case would Sam&#x2019;s and Marnie&#x2019;s boat sinking activities have a distributive
goal.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 223--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Where an agent or her activities are related to a goal in such a way that the agent
could succeed relative to this goal in some situations where other agents were also
successful relative to the same goal, let us say that this goal relation is <text:span text:style-name="Emphasis" ><text:span 
text:style-name="cmti-12">compatible with</text:span>
<text:span 
text:style-name="cmti-12">others&#x2019; success</text:span></text:span>. We have just noted that distributive goals by definition require
compatibility with others&#x2019; success.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 226--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   How is this compatibility achieved? How could the relation between Sam&#x2019;s activities
and the goal be such as to allow both Sam and Marnie to succeed in sinking the boat?
One possibility involves Sam having an intention which is explicitly neutral concerning
others&#x2019; success. For example, Sam might intend that he sink the boat either alone or
with any other revellers. A second, more interesting possibility is that Sam&#x2019;s intention is
simply an intention to sink the boat. This intention does not specify who will sink the
boat; it is not the intention that he, Sam, sink the boat. Of course, the fact
that this intention is Sam&#x2019;s intention means that Sam will have to be among
the sinkers of the boat to succeed. So Sam&#x2019;s overall relation to the goal is
such that his involvement is required for its fulfilment, even though this is
                                                                                

                                                                                
not specified in the content of his intention. It does not follow that Sam&#x2019;s
intention or any other aspect of his relation to the goal requires him to be the sole
sinker of the boat in order to succeed. We can allow that there may be ways of
elaborating the story about Sam on which his success requires him to sink
the boat alone. But there are also ways of elaborating the story such that
this is not a requirement&#x2014;being well into the festive spirit, Sam has given no
thought at all to whether others will sink the boat, and there are no relevant
conventions or norms. The existence of these elaborations shows that to be
related to a goal in a way that is compatible with others&#x2019; success does not
require having intentions whose contents explicitly involve agents. In some
conditions, acting on an intention whose content does not involve agency is
sufficient for being related to a goal in a way that is compatible with others&#x2019;
success.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 239--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   On standard accounts of shared intention, compatibility with others&#x2019; success involves
the first of these two possibilities, that is, an intention whose contents explicitly involves
other agents. For instance, on Bratman&#x2019;s account of shared intention our sharing an
intention to paint a house involves us each intending that <text:span text:style-name="Emphasis" ><text:span 
text:style-name="cmti-12">we</text:span></text:span> paint the house
(<t4htlink 
href="#XBratman:1992mi">Bratman</t4htlink><text:s/><t4htlink 
href="#XBratman:1992mi">1992</t4htlink>, p.<text:s/>333). We have just been arguing that compatibility with others&#x2019;
success does not require intentions with contents that explicitly involve agency. This
matters because we are concerned with forms of joint action that require little
conceptual sophistication. Eventually we shall show that inability to represent other
agents as agents is no bar to engaging in some forms of joint action (that is, to engaging
in some goal-directed actions comprising two or more agents&#x2019; goal-directed
activities). For now the point is just that distributive goals, despite requiring
compatibility with others&#x2019; success, do not require abilities to represent other agents as
agents.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 246--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   For readers who doubt that compatibility with others&#x2019; success is really possible
unless the contents of agents&#x2019; intentions explicitly allow for it, we offer two
considerations. The first is an imaginative exercise. Luke&#x2019;s goal is to destroy the brick
wall of a neighbour&#x2019;s front garden. He passes this wall every day. In order to escape
detection he removes a little of the pointing from the wall every time he passes it. Over
time his activities destabilise the wall and it collapses. As we have described this
situation, it is of course possible to elaborate it further, adding features which render
Luke&#x2019;s relation to the goal incompatible with others&#x2019; success. But no such
features need be present and we shall stipulate that they are absent. Now
consider the possibility that after the wall collapses, Luke discovers to his surprise
that an acquaintance had the same goal and, with no knowledge of Luke&#x2019;s
intention or activities, has been working to the same end as Luke. Whether this
possibility is actual seems to have no bearing on Luke&#x2019;s success relative to his
goal; to know that Luke has succeeded we do not have to know that no other
                                                                                

                                                                                
agents were involved. This is so even though Luke&#x2019;s goal was simply to destroy
the wall and did not explicitly involve agency. The gradual nature of these
activities makes the possibility vivid, but many less gradual actions such as getting
a car back onto the road or catching a particular throw are no different in
principle.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 259--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The second consideration is that intentions can be neutral on a wide variety of issues
concerning how a goal is achieved. To return to Luke&#x2019;s destruction of the wall, our
description is consistent with neutrality on a wide variety of contributing factors. Luke&#x2019;s
success in destroying the wall is independent of whether design faults also contribute
to its fall, and of contributions from bad weather, moss or bacteria. (Such
contributions may lessen his responsibility but, given our description of the
situation, they would not prevent his success.) Luke&#x2019;s success is also clearly
independent of whether other agents with different goals are involved in the wall&#x2019;s
destruction. One person sits on the wall to rest her legs, another displays bravado by
kicking it in front of her friends while a third removes some pointing in order
to conceal chewing gum. All three contribute to the wall&#x2019;s destruction, but
not in a way that prevents Luke from fulfilling his intention to destroy the
wall. Given that Luke&#x2019;s relation to the goal can be compatible with potential
contributions such as these, it seems clear that it can also be compatible with
others&#x2019; success even where what the others intend is the same as what Luke
intends.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 268--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Some goals do not allow for compatibility with others&#x2019; success. For instance, if
Andrew intends to win a certain prize and the competition is structured in such a way
that ties are impossible, then compatibility with others&#x2019; success is impossible. But for
many goals&#x2014;eating a certain pizza, lifting a heavy block, and so on&#x2014;compatibility with
respect to others&#x2019; success is possible.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 271--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Where multiple agents&#x2019; activities have a distributive goal there is a sense in which
their activities are directed to a goal. But this may amount only to each agent&#x2019;s
activities being individually directed to that goal. In that case, the question about how
joint actions relate to their goals would not be interestingly different from the
parallel question about individual actions. To make the joint version of the
question interestingly different, we need cases where multiple agents&#x2019; activities
being directed to a goal is not, or not only, a matter of each agent&#x2019;s activities
individually being directed to that goal. What, in addition to a distributive
goal, could be involved in two or more agents&#x2019; activities being directed to a
goal?

</text:p> 
<!--l. 282--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The notion of a collective goal assumes that of coordination. This should be
understood in a very broad sense. If some knights tasked with finding a sacred cup agree
that each will search on a different continent, their activities count as coordinated.
Equally, when two agents between them lift a heavy block by means of each agent
pulling on either end of a rope connected to the block via a system of pulleys, their
pullings count as coordinated just because the rope relates the force each exerts on
the block to the force exerted by the other. In this second case, the agent&#x2019;s
activities are coordinated by a mechanism in their environment, the rope, rather
than by any psychological mechanism (of course lifting the block may well
require other, perhaps psychological, forms of coordination). By invoking a broad
notion of coordination and invoking coordination of activities rather than of
agents, the definition of collective goal avoids direct appeal to psychological
states.

Conceptually it would be simpler to characterise collective goals by appeal only to what
actually happens&#x2014;that is, to replace the third clause with the requirement that the
coordination actually facilitate the occurrence of the goal-outcome. Why is the appeal
to what would normally happen necessary? Consider a case in which two agents&#x2019;
activities do have a collective goal and coordination of their activities actually
facilitates the goal-outcome&#x2019;s occurrence: John and Anika fell a tree using a
two-handled saw. Now imagine a case which is as similar as possible to this
one except that John becomes exhausted and they have to give up half way
through. In this modified case the coordination of John&#x2019;s and Anika&#x2019;s activities
does not facilitate the occurrence of the outcome (the felling of the tree). This
is simply because the outcome does not occur. But the differences between
the two cases are not the sorts of difference that generally determine facts
about which goals an activity is directed to. Whether activities succeed or fail
does not generally play any role in determining what their goals were. So an
adequate account of collective goals must allow that agents&#x2019; activities can
have collective goals even where they fail. This is one reason for appealing
to what would normally happen in characterising collective goals. A second,
                                                                                

                                                                                
more direct but less obvious reason involves external factors which render
coordination inefficacious. For an illustration, suppose that Isabel and Rudi are in
the habit of lifting heavy blocks by each pulling on a rope. Normally and on
nearly all occasions either could lift any of the blocks alone but, providing their
pullings are coordinated, the task is easier when done jointly; and no matter how
uncoordinated they are, the way the ropes are arranged means that it is never
normally harder for them to lift a block jointly than alone. Normally, then,
coordination facilitates the blocks being lifted. On one exceptional occasion
John, a third person, intervenes. John dislikes coordination between people
and so, seeing the coordination of Isabel&#x2019;s and Rudi&#x2019;s activities, he grabs a
rope and attempts to prevent the block being lifted. Although John fails, he
does make the joint lifting harder than it would have been for either Isabel or
Rudi to lift the block alone. So in this exceptional case the coordination of
their activities hinders rather than facilitates the blocks being lifted. But this
case, where John intervenes, does not differ from the normal cases in ways
that are relevant to facts about the goals of the agents&#x2019; activities. For this
reason it would be a mistake to ascribe a collective goal to Isabel&#x2019;s and Rudi&#x2019;s
activities in the normal cases but not in the case where John intervenes. This is
why appeal to normal conditions is a necessary in characterising collective
goals.

there is a sense in which, taken together, the activities are directed to their collective

there is coordination among their activities which plays a role in bringing about
the collective goal. We can put this in terms of the direction metaphor. Any
structure or mechanism providing this coordination is directing the agents&#x2019;
activities to the collective goal. The notion of a collective goal therefore already
provides one way of making sense of the idea that joint actions are goal-directed

goal.

understand how joint actions could be related to their goals in the absence of

to identify one way in which joint actions are related to their goals. This is
compatible with maintaining that there are other ways in which joint actions can be
related to their goals and that the relation we have identified does not hold in
every case of joint action. We return to this issue in section<text:s/><t4htlink

</text:p> 
<!--l. 331--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   To sum up so far, understanding how joint actions relate to their goals requires the
notion of a collective goal in addition to that of a shared intention.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 333--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The notion of a collective goal involves too little to provide dramatic new insights
into the nature of joint action. Why devote a whole paper to such a simple notion? One
reason is the mystique surrounding joint action, which is sometimes introduced by
reference to elusive notions of togetherness or jointness (compare <t4htlink 
href="#Xgilbert_walking_1990">Gilbert</t4htlink><text:s/><t4htlink

href="#XBratman:2009lv">2009</t4htlink>, p.<text:s/>150). It is important that the puzzle about how joint actions
could be related to their goals in the absence of shared intention can be solved
with appeal only to minimal, uncontroversial ingredients. The existence of
collective goals shows that we can coherently think about joint action without
starting from underspecified notions of jointness and without invoking ideas
of togetherness which are somehow distinct from any involved in the three
legs of a tripod supporting a camera together. A second reason for focusing
on collective goals is that this notion identifies a common starting point for
different psychological approaches to joint action. There is currently much
debate between researchers who focus on behavioural dynamics (e.g.<text:s/><t4htlink 
href="#Xmarsh_social_2009">Marsh
et<text:s/>al.</t4htlink><text:s/><t4htlink

href="#Xschmidt_richardons:_2008">Schmidt &#x0026; Richardson</t4htlink><text:s/><t4htlink 
href="#Xschmidt_richardons:_2008">2008</t4htlink>) and those whose approach to
explaining how joint action is possible primarily involves motor cognition and
representation (e.g.<text:s/><t4htlink 
href="#XSebanz:2005fk">Sebanz et<text:s/>al.</t4htlink><text:s/><t4htlink

href="#XKnoblich:2006bn">2006</t4htlink>). As
things stand, it is sometimes hard to identify the common ground necessary
for the two approaches to be in genuine disagreement. The account of joint
action in terms of collective goals identifies what both approaches can agree
on. The substantial questions concern which types of coordination exist in
joint action, and to what extent characterising any given type of coordination
requires appeal to general dynamical principles or to motor cognition and
representational control structures. The notion of a collective goal, then, is offered not
                                                                                

                                                                                
as something which already provides deep insight into what joint action is
but as part of a minimal framework for the construction of more substantial
accounts.

<!--l. 363--><text:p text:style-name="Text-body">Collective goals are conceptually distinct from shared intentions. Shared intentions are,
or resemble, states of agents. By contrast a collective goal is primarily an attribute of
activities, not of agents. Furthermore, a shared intention is something that coordinates
multiple agents&#x2019; activities. Appeal to a shared intention is therefore potentially a way of
explaining how agents coordinate their activities. By contrast, collective goals are not
the sort of thing that can coordinate anything; their existence presupposes
coordination. Finally, shared intentions are supposed to be shared by agents in
something resembling the sense in which conspirators can share a secret, not only in
the sense in which two people can share a name. It would be a distortion to
claim that the notion of a collective goals is the notion of something agents
share.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 365--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   There is a potentially more fundamental contrast between shared intentions and
collective goals. A shared intention integrates two functions: it determines what the
action is by specifying its goal and it coordinates agents&#x2019; activities. By contrast, no
single element provides both functions in the account of the relation between joint
actions and their goals which appeals to collective goals.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 367--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   We should not infer from this alone that there are, or even that there might be,
shared intentions without collective goals. That collective goals and shared
intentions are conceptually distinct does not imply that one can exist without the
other.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 369--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Even so, it may be true that agents sometimes share intentions without their
activities having any corresponding collective goal. To illustrate, suppose that four
merchants get together and agree to fix their prices with the shared intention that they
will each become rich enough to retire by the end of the year. The year turns
out to be good for trade and the merchants&#x2019; shared intention is realised. As
it happens these merchants are excellent traders but poor strategists. Their
profits would have been even larger if they had not colluded in fixing prices. In
fact their price-fixing strategy was so flawed that it could not normally have
had a positive effect on profits. So their attempts at coordination hindered
rather than facilitated the realisation of their shared intention. Because the
existence of a collective goal requires coordination of agents&#x2019; activities to be
such that it would normally facilitate the occurrence of the goal, no collective
goal of the merchants&#x2019; activities as here described corresponds to their shared
intention.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 377--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The possibility that shared intentions exist without there being corresponding
                                                                                

                                                                                
collective goals is not a superficial feature of the way we have defined collective goal.
Where there are shared intentions, one or more propositional attitudes serve to link the
agents and their goals with any means of coordination. For example, the merchants
described above believe, falsely, that coordinating their pricing will facilitate fulfilment
of their shared intention. Apart from their beliefs and other propositional attitudes,
nothing appropriately connects their coordination to their activities and their goal.
In characterising collective goals our aim is to better understand how joint
actions are related to their goals when such propositional attitudes are absent.
In the case of collective goals, then, the link between a goal and a means of
coordination can only involve facts, not beliefs or expectations, about its efficacy.
This is why, on standard accounts of shared intention, it is possible for agents
to act on shared intentions without there being any corresponding collective
goal.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 385--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   We began this paper with a preliminary identification of a broad class of joint
actions. Our concern is with joint actions which involve two or more agents&#x2019;
goal-directed activities where the activities taken together are directed to a goal and
this is not, or not only, a matter of each agent&#x2019;s activities being individually
directed to that goal. Characterising how joint actions relate to their goals
is essential for more fully understanding what joint actions are. Given the
premise that shared intentions exist, we have shown that there are at least two
ways in which joint actions relate to their goals. Sometimes joint actions are
related to their goals by virtue of the agents&#x2019; shared intention, and sometimes
joint actions are related to their goals by virtue of the collective goal of the
activities comprising them. These relations are empirically distinct. It is possible
for joint actions to involve shared intentions with no corresponding collective
goals and it is possible for joint actions to involve collective goals without
any shared intentions. So there are at least two kinds of goal-directed joint
action.

<!--l. 400--><text:p text:style-name="Text-body">The requirements for agents&#x2019; activities to have a collective goal can be met without the
agents being aware that they are met (these requirements are given on page<text:s/><t4htlink 
href="#x1-40004">12</t4htlink>). This is
because two agents&#x2019; activities can be coordinated without either agent intending to
coordinate, and even without the agents being aware that their activities are
coordinated (<t4htlink 
href="#XSebanz:2003kf">Sebanz et<text:s/>al.</t4htlink><text:s/><t4htlink

href="#Xschmidt_understanding_2010">Schmidt et<text:s/>al.</t4htlink><text:s/><t4htlink 
href="#Xschmidt_understanding_2010">2010</t4htlink>). It follows that two agents&#x2019;
activities might have a collective goal and that the agents might be engaged in
a joint action together even though each agent&#x2019;s overall knowledge state is
consistent with the possibility that she is acting alone. But (runs the objection)
it is surely true that the agents involved in a joint action must each be in a
position to know that she or he is not acting individually. So the account we have
                                                                                

                                                                                
offered of how joint actions relate to their goals is mistaken, or so the objection
entails.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 410--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   There are two possible responses to this objection. One would be to modify the
definition of collective goal. For instance, we could add this requirement: concerning the
outcome which is the collective goal, each agent must know both that this outcome is a
distributive goal of some (or all) of the activities comprising the joint action and also
that some of these activities are her own activities. This further stipulation
would avoid the objection by entailing that where some agents&#x2019; activities have a
collective goal, each agent is in a position to know she is not acting individually.
Note that this modification requires only that the agents of a joint action are
able to represent distributive goals and to identify activities as their own. The
modified account retains consistency with the possibility that agents can engage in
joint action without being able to represent intentions or other propositional
attitudes.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 419--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   This first response is only acceptable if there are grounds to think that the objection
is correct. For it would be a mistake complicate the definition of collective
goal without decisive reasons for doing so. A second possible response to the
objection is to reject its second premise, that is, to reject that claim that each
agent of a joint action must be in a position to know that she is not acting
alone.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 425--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Several philosophers have implied that this claim is true. Kutz asserts that
participants in a joint action have &#x2018;a conception of themselves as contributors to a
collective end&#x2019; (<t4htlink

participant &#x2026;<text:s/>can answer the question of what he is doing or will be doing by saying for
example &#x201C;We are walking together&#x201D; or &#x201C;We will/intend to walk together&#x201D;&#x2019; (<t4htlink

that her actions are interdependent with the others&#x2019;. If any of these assertions are
true then each agent of any joint action is in a position to know she is not
acting alone. As far as we know, no arguments have yet been given for these

<!--l. 438--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The lack of argument suggests that common sense or intuition may be what grounds
these assertions. Is this plausible? Start by distinguishing the claim at issue from related
claims which are consistent with the unmodified account of collective goals. The
unmodified account entails the possibility of joint actions with agents who are not all
individually in a position to know that they are not acting alone. It does not follow (and
it is no part of our view) that such cases are either teleologically normal or theoretically
significant. It is possible that coordination mechanisms on which effective joint
                                                                                

                                                                                
action hinges are such that it is teleologically normal for them to facilitate
joint action only when agents intend or expect to coordinate their actions. If
so, there is a sense in which joint actions without some minimal awareness
of jointness are not normal, and they may also lack theoretical significance.
This would be consistent with the unmodified account. So any grounds which
support the objection have to distinguish the claim at issue, which concerns
conceptual or logical possibility, from similar claims about what is teleologically
normal or theoretically significant. Common sense and intuition are not generally
reliable when it comes to such fine distinctions, nor when it comes to deciding
borderline or limiting cases. Further, it is plausible that different people have
inconsistent intuitions about what counts as joint action. These considerations
indicate that the objection cannot be grounded on intuition or common sense
alone.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 451--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   As things stand, we lack decisive grounds both for accepting the objection and for
rejecting it. For this reason we tentatively endorse the second response and
stick with the unmodified definition of collective goals. Even if this were a
mistake, the first response above shows that the objection can be avoided
by adding to the definition; this addition would not substantially alter our
conclusions.

<!--l. 458--><text:p text:style-name="Text-body">The question was how joint actions are related to their goals. On most contemporary
accounts of joint action the answers hinge on shared intention. Shared intentions do for
joint actions what non-shared intentions do for non-joint actions: they coordinate
activities and specify the goals to which these activities are directed. Given the notion
of shared intention, whether an action is individual or joint makes almost no
difference to an explanation of the relation between actions and their goals. This is
why the question about how joint actions relate to their goals has not been
considered. The question only becomes pressing because, as psychological and
philosophical research on joint action reveals, there are joint actions without shared
intentions.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 465--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The existence of joint actions without shared intentions is at least superficially
puzzling. It is puzzling because, given existing accounts of what joint action is, it is
unclear how a joint action could be directed to a goal except by virtue of something like
a shared intention.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 470--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Our solution, which may not be the only possible solution, involved two steps. The
first step concerned distributive goals. An outcome is a <text:span text:style-name="Emphasis" ><text:span

agents&#x2019; activities just if this outcome is a goal to which each agent&#x2019;s activities are
individually directed where it is possible for all agents (not just any agent, all of them
together) to succeed relative to this goal. Distributive goals do not require intentions or
                                                                                

                                                                                
thought about others&#x2019; agency.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 476--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The notion of distributive goal is not sufficient to explain how joint actions are
related to goals, as we saw.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 478--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The second step in solving the puzzle was to introduce the notion of a collective
goal. An outcome is by definition a collective goal of multiple agents&#x2019; activities when
(a) this outcome is a distributive goal of the activities; (b) the activities are
coordinated; and (c) occurrences of an outcome of this type would normally be
facilitated by coordination of this type. Where there is a collective goal there is
a sense in which the agents&#x2019; activities are directed to this goal, and this is
not only a matter of each agent&#x2019;s activities being individually so directed. So
the notion of a collective goal provides one way of making sense of the claim
that there are joint actions which are goal-directed but do not involve shared
intentions.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 481--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   The point of elucidating the notion of a collective goal is not that this notion by
itself identifies a theoretically significant form of joint action. Its value lies in showing
how there could be goal-directed joint actions without shared intention, and in
providing the foundation on which more significant forms of jointness in action are
built.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 484--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   How should we think of joint action in the light of this discussion? Differences in the
ways that actions (joint or individual) relate to their goals can demarcate different kinds
of action. Accordingly, we saw that the notions of collective goal and shared intention
are associated with two kinds of joint action. There is no straightforward hierarchical
relation between these kinds of joint action. For, as we saw, some joint actions involve
collective goals but no shared intentions while others involve shared intentions without
corresponding collective goals. There are, however, several ways in which these two
kinds of joint action may be related. First, the contents of propositional attitudes which
are or comprise shared intentions can refer to joint actions involving collective
goals; because collective goals do not constitutively involve intentions, this
involves no threat of circularity and raises no issues about well-foundedness.
Second, joint actions involving only collective goals may be proper parts of larger
structures which do involve shared intention, much as (on some views) merely
purpose activities can be components of actions that are intentional in a stronger
sense. Third, collective goals and the associated form of joint action may be
a precursor, in evolution or development (or both), to the potentially more
cognitively and conceptually demanding forms of joint action associated with shared
intention.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 494--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   It is no part of our view that there are just two forms of joint action. One
reason for suspecting there may be greater heterogeneity in the notion of joint
action turns on background facts about shared intention. There are different
philosophical accounts of what shared intention is. At least some of these are
                                                                                

                                                                                
inconsistent if interpreted as competing accounts of a single phenomenon. Despite
this, each account appears to be conceptually coherent and there are do not
appear to be arguments which decisively favour one account over its apparent
competitors. This diversity may be partly due to the fact that the term &#x2018;shared
intention&#x2019; is metaphorical, for (given some plausible premises) shared intentions are
neither literally shared nor literally intentions. It is possible, then, that not
all of the different ways of developing the metaphor are in fact competing
accounts of a single phenomenon. Instead there may be multiple targets of
analysis, and these might be linked to further distinctions among kinds of joint
action.
</text:p> 
<!--l. 503--><text:p text:style-name="First-line-indent">   Forms of joint action which are goal-directed but involve nothing like shared
intention have been neglected by philosophers, perhaps partly because they are, or are
thought to be, too simple to present conceptual puzzles. This is a mistake. To
understand the cognitive bases of abilities to engage in joint action or their
evolution or development, the fact that a conception of joint action presents
conceptual puzzles is no virtue. It may be better to start with the simplest possible
notions, such as those of distributive and collective goal, and add the minimum
required to further demarcate the category of interest in any given inquiry. Fully
understanding joint action may require shared intention and other philosophically
problematic notions; but understanding goal-directed joint action at its most basic
requires nothing like shared intention, and no more than the notion of a collective
goal.
