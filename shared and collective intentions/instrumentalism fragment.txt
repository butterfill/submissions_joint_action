THIRD ATTEMPT

Sometimes `joint action' and related terms are used intuitively.
One difficulty with relying exclusively on intuition is that different people seem to have different intuitions about which events are joint actions.
We can mitigate this difficulty by starting with a broad, instrumental presumption about joint action.
	Take one or more events involving the goal-direct actions of multiple agents.
	Where some observers (or participants) could usefully construe these events as if they constituted a single goal-directed action, we shall presume that these events constitute a joint action in the absence of stronger reasons for supposing that they are not.
In other words, where there is some value in thinking of multiple agents' goal-directed actions as if comprised were a single action, we shall presume that they either do comprise a single action or else that they resemble a single action in ways that mean they constitute a joint action.


The instrumental presumption would not be reasonable if we were primarily concerned to characterise people's intuitions about joint action.
In fact our primary concern is with articulating notions relevant to scientific research.




SECOND ATTEMPT

We can mitigate this difficulty by starting with a broad, instrumental presumption about joint action.
	Take one or more events involving the goal-direct actions of multiple agents.
	Where some observers (or participants) could usefully construe these events as if they constituted a single goal-directed action, we shall presume that these events constitute a joint action.

This instrumental view is not supposed to be a deep truth about the nature of joint action.  
In fact it may not even be true.  The fact that it is some way useful to think of a sequence of events as if they comprised a single goal-directed action does not show that these events do comprise a single action.
But the instrumental view is a better starting point than either bare intuition or mere stipulation given that our concern is not directly with characterising people's intuitions but with articulating notions relevant to scientific research.



FIRST ATTEMPT

Sometimes `joint action' and related terms are used intuitively.
One difficulty with relying exclusively on intuition is that different people seem to have different intuitions about which events are joint actions.
We can mitigate this difficulty by starting with a broad, instrumental view of joint action.
On the instrumental view, a joint action is a sequence of one or more events involving the goal-direct actions of multiple agents where some observers (or participants) could usefully construe the events as if they constituted a single goal-directed action.

This instrumental view is not supposed to be a deep truth about the nature of joint action.  
In fact it may not even be true.  The fact that it is some way useful to think of a sequence of events as if they comprised a single goal-directed action does not show that these events do comprise a single action.
But the instrumental view is a better starting point than either bare intuition or mere stipulation given that our concern is not directly with characterising people's intuitions but with articulating notions relevant to scientific research.

For the fact that it is useful to construe multiple agents' activities as if they were a single action motivates investigation of that case in a way that mere stipulations and bare intuitions do not.
