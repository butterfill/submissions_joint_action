1. we are about to engage in some or other joint action
2. my only goal is to F
therefore:
3. their goal is to F

Problem: how does knowing that their goal is 'to find the teddy [plural]' help me to understand the goal of their utterance 'in the bed'?  If I really can't see this as relevant to finding the teddy, perhaps I should doubt whether we are about to engage in joint action?

Same goes for the point to the cup.  The point has drawn my attention and I haven't found what I was looking for.  I know your goal in pointing is to find the reward [plural].  But how does this help me to understand the more immediate goal of your pointing action?  (The reach is a try but fail ... but I still have to work out that you were trying to reach not for the object but for the thing inside the container.)
