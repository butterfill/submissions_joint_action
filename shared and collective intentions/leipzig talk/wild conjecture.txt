joint action LEIPZIG

wild conjecture
-----------------------------------
Human social cognition, including full-blown theory of mind cognition, is built on capacities for joint action and their exercise.

cf. Moll & Tomasello

Two reasons why this conjecture, despite its imprecise formulation, seems wild:

1. The ability to ascribe false beliefs is a hallmark of full-blown theory of mind cognition; we now know that this ability appears at around 14 months or even earlier; and we may eventually find it in non-human primates or corvids.

2. All joint actions involve shared intention; shared intention presupposes the ability to ascribe you knowledge of my intentions about your intentions; this sophisticated capacity is already distinctive of human social cognition;  there is not social cognition much left for joint action to explain.

I do have things to say about the first point but here I want to focus on the second.

So I'm not trying to establish the wild conjecture, only to remove one obstacle to its acceptance.
