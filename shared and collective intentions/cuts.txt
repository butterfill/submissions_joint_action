Here is a scenario we shall use throughout.
Nora and Olive killed Fred.  
Each fired a shot.
Neither shot was individually fatal but together they were deadly.
An ambulance arrived on the scene almost at once but Fred didn't make it to the hospital.
What would it take for Nora and Olive's killing of Fred to be a joint action?
