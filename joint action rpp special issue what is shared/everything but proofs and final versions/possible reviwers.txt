reviewers

[*=for steve, @=Natalie, #=promising, &=possible low quality, !=doubtful relevance]


#@ROPP27 Title: Understanding the perception-action processes involved in social interaction: the case of manual search behavior for hidden objects in toddlers
	Someone who knows about A-not-B plus someone philosophical (Matt Nudds?); good paper.  Should ask author to ask an additional question linking the paper to the CFP question.  Should ask reviewers to comment on match between paper and cfp.  
	Celia Brownell, Henrike Moll, Matt Nudds

[done=3]*#ROPP31 Title: Rationality and the unit of action
	Someone who knows reasons for 	action and decision theory (nothing technical); Natalie Gold would be ideal candidate, but many philosophers of action would do; failing Gold, ask Bardsley, Nagatsu, Manchester, Roth, Bart Streumer.  Heiner. Rowland Stout.

[done=2/1,todo=1]*&ROPP36 Title: Explaining Social Reality: Are the Notions of Collective Intentionality and Background Apt for the Job?
	someone who knows Searle, but low quality: NOT Tollefsen, NOT Elisabeth Pacherie, ... look in Paris, generic

[done=2]*&!ROPP41 Title: Folk psychology, joint action and science
	[basically about anti-individualism]: Till, Alex Kelly
	
@###ROPP42 Title: Stag Hunts and Committee Work: Cooperation and the Mutualistic Paradigm
	Includes suggested reviewers, excellent paper, def. needs phil & psych combination.  Could ask Bratman.
	Hannes Rackoczy, Bratman, Silk, Jennifer Hudin Berkeley (?)
	
@#ROPP43 Title: Joint Actions, Shared Feelings, and Cross-Creatural Embodiment
	someone who knows about motor action, gaze following & joint attention, def. needs phil & psych.  Author suggests reviewers but these are not so useful.  Lots of embodied but would be fine to have reviewer who didn't get that stuff. 
	Sinigalia, Mark Sprevak; Wolfgang Prinz
	Phil, Louise Richardson?  Richard Moore (but prioritise ROPP46)
	
[done=2,todo=Tom Pink]*&ROPP44 Title: Collective Intentionality, Documents, and Social Reality
	might be ok; similar to ROPP42 in some respects; someone who cares about ontology of joint action. Needs philosopher, probably doesn't need psy. ???
	Steve take & look in Encyc: Kirk Ludwig, Kisolo-Ssonko, Tom Pink
	
[done=2,todo=somby][&?]*ROPP45 Title: Four Forms of Social Action
	needs a philosopher, probably not a psych.  About ontology.
	David Schweikard david.schweikard@gmx.net; a somby [tbd] & Oliver Rashbrook

@#ROPP46 Title: Joint Attention: from Interaction to Joint Action
	Development plus philosophy (it's about the first year of life).  
	Richard Moore, Chris Moore [dev], a somby [Anna], Johannes Roessler
	
#ROPP47 Title: From joint action to action control: Functional equivalence between acting together and acting alone
	It's about precise timing (no language) using forward models (Grush) and emulation; it's also about phenomenology.  Mainly psych but would benefit from a philosopher who can bear reading psych papers.
	
##*ROPP49 Title: A case for disjoint action
	Highly relevant to CFP, competent and better than the abstract suggests.  Phil only.  Kutz?  Helen Steward; Peacocke
	
&ROPP50 Title: Teaching and learning: joint action in didactic action
	[don't mind who but this is going to be hard work to review!]
	
ROPP51 Title: Radical Contextualism and the Limits of Sharedness
	I don't understand the asbtract, first paragraphs are more promising.  It's about linguistic communication, suggests Derdrie Wilson as a reviewer.  Could ask Guy Longworth, Christophe Heinz, Siegfried J. Schmidt sjschmidt@gmx.de

*ROPP52 Title: The subject of shared intentions
	argues for plural subjects.  Unlikely to make it but should be reviewed at least by a phil.  Someone who knows about intention and philosophy of action.  Constantine Sandis?  Maria Alvarez?
	
##ROPP53 Title: The social motivation for joint action
	suggests more research on motivation rather than mechanisms needed.  Should be reviewed by a mechanisms person (Cordula Vesper?) plus at least one joint action person

&ROPP54 Title: Joint Attentional Declarative Pointing: Shared Intentionality A (Action) and Shared Intentionality R (Representation)
	I don't understand the title.  Its about pointing & vygotsky: Ulf L., would be useful to have a neuro person.  Fabia Franco (psych on pointing). Must have a phil person=JAMES MORAUTA
	
##*ROPP58 Title: Playing one's part
	hard-core: Christopher McMahon, Matt Soteriou, Tuomela
	
&ROPP59, Title: Socially extended intentions-in-action	
	Tollefsen (it's about her) plus a hard philosopher (doesn't matter who).
