Reviewer 2

The selection of recent literature in the case of some of the authors
is not quite up to date as more relevant philosophical work—both
“collectivistic” and “individualistic”—has appeared during the last
decade or so. Let me mention, too, that in the
Collective Intentionality conferences held biannually since 1999 there
has been much discussion and many papers on joint action.


Reviewer 3

*reciprocal commentary* "one possible risk is that the philosophical and the
psychological contributions be loosely connected or even just
juxtaposed. It is very important to stimulate joint work between those
philosophers and psychologists that will participate, or at least, let
each other review their own particular contributions and react from
each other perspective. We would suggest to design the issue with this
aim in mind, and solicit contributors to include reciprocal commentary
within the special issue."

"we suggest the guest editors to create a contact with the
wide community of *Collective Intentionality* (beyond the occasional
reference to Bratman and Gilbert) that is very relevant for this
exchange. See for instance the following European Social Network:
http://cipp.unibas.ch/activities/network/"

"whether it would not be the case to involve
more other research traditions like game-theory, economics, in order
not to worry only about “how” (cognitively) we jointly act, but also
“why”: motivations (as fundamental mental mechanisms), personal
expectations, etc. And – in particular – enlightening the fundamental
“normative” aspects, reciprocal expectations and monitoring and
“sanctions”, regulating human joint action. Going in those more
“social” direction on the one side is required by the object itself,
for a more adequate theory of the phenomenon, for detaching joint
intention/action from joint motor-intention/action; by the need for
differentiation of this issue, and the objective to involve a larger
number of addresses One should explicitly focus also on the sharing or
not sharing of the motivations, in a joint action."
