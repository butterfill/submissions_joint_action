Dear Anika,

Many thanks for submitting 'Joint Attention: from Interaction to Joint Action' to the RPP special issue on on Joint Action: What Is Shared.  I am sorry that it has taken us rather long to get back to you.

The three reviewers all recommend not accepting the paper without major revisions, and they have provided detailed comments (attached).  Natalie Sebanz and I have also read your paper and agree with this.  But we also see many positive points and so would be willing to consider a substantially revised paper if you and your co-author are prepared to undertake major revisions in the light of the reviewers' comments.

You will see that each reviewer has focused on different themes arising from your paper.  If you decided to resubmit a revised version of the paper, it would be fine to focus on and expand just a small part of the present paper (for example, investigating the role of joint attention in joint action is surely worth a paper in its own right).

I'm sorry to be the bearer of this disappointing news.  The good part is that your project is clearly rich and interesting; perhaps it just needs to be executed more slowly.

Please let us know what you decided about resubmission either way.  To allow for another round of reviews (which will be quicker than the first), we would need a revision by 31 January 2011.

best wishes,
Steve
