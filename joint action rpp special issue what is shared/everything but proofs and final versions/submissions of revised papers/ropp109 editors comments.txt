You use the terms 'shared motivation' and 'social motivation'.  (1) if these terms are used interchangably it would be better to use only one of them.  (2) these terms need more explication than they are given.  The use of the quote in introducing them on p. 1 is helpful but suggests that social motivation always involves motivation by the possibility of having a certain kind of experience.  This is not obviously compatible with the claim (also in need of clarification) that shared motivation is 'essentially social in character' (p. 2).


p. 2 fn. 1: 'a concept of joint action, which ...' --- delete comma (typo)

p. 3 'I propose we adopt the definition that Sebanz et al. propose in their review article ...'.  As you note in fn.2, this definition is unclear on a critical point.  In addition the definition appeals to an unspecified notion of social interaction.  For these reasons it is not a good starting point for a philosopher.  I suggest you offer a more careful definition, possibly inspired by Sebanz et al, rather than simply quoting it.

p. 4: 'they have a joint target goal and/ or a shared intention to get the job done' --- say which or explain the uncertainty.  Also do not use 'and/or' (style).

p. 5: 'is no apparent' --- typo

p. 5: 'there is in considerable tension between their target goals for the negotiation' --- typo
