Dear NN,

Thank you again for agreeing to contribute to our special issue of the Review of Philosophy and Psychology on 'Joint Action: what is shared?' After discussing dates with the journal's editors, I am hoping that  you will be happy to agree to submit the invited paper by 1st Jan 2011. If it makes it easier, your paper could be quite short ... or quite long.

The editors persuaded us that we should aim for a slightly earlier date than we would ideally like, although it is much closer to our preferred date than theirs. We really appreciate you agreeing to contribute at all and apologize for the changing deadline.

Please confirm that you will be able to submit your paper by 1st January.

best wishes,
Steve
