Woodward

p. 4 : What does 'genuinely joint actions' mean?  Later on the page you talk about 'an extended agent', so I guess that being a genuinely joint action has to do with whether the agent of an action is an extended agent.  Later (p. 16) you suggest that theories of team reasoning which require group identification are consistent with the mirroring requirement, so I inferred actions involving intentions arrived at by team reasoning count as genuinely joint.  It would be good to clarify this briefly so that readers understand what the mirroring assumption is.

Conclusion:  This is not required but would be very welcome.  Could you add a paragraph to the conclusion linking the discussion back to the unit of action in joint action specifically (and especially the first paragraph).
