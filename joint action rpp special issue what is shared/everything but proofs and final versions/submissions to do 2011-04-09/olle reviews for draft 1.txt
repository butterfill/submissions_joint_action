I really enjoyed reading this paper.  I think it handles a substantive problem in the joint action literature--overcoming the solipsistic constraint.  The paper needs to be proofed carefully.  There are several places where there are missing words or typos.  But otherwise, the organization and structure is very good.  I have no substantive criticisms.  But here are a few things the author might think about:

1.  The author gives the following gloss on "several" philosophical accounts (abstract and pg. 1):  "when two or more agents (?--typo here--missing word) in a small scale joint activity J, each of them typically have a commitment to make J come about: an intention of the form "I intend that we J."  
I wonder who this gloss is meant to cover?  I worry that people like Kutz will say this gloss doesn't apply to him and given the distinction between commitments and intentions perhaps even Bratman will balk.  I wonder if a footnote here saying that you are focusing on some accounts and not others would help?  Where does Gilbert fit in all of this for you?  Is her account guilty of violating the solipsistic constraint? The author suggests at the end that maybe Searle's account of we intention would avoid violating solipsistic account? Maybe the problem then isn't just with the solipsistic constraint but with the form of the collective intention?  

2.  I think more needs to be done to explain why the author things toddlers can't have socially extended intentions in action.  The author simply says that it is doubtful and points to that fact that toddlers "do not appear to be in a good position to establish the kind of fluent expertise that makes coordination during joint activity transparent."  Why not?  The issue is difficult, isn't it because one of the ways in which the author argues for social extended intentions in action is by reflection on the phenomenology of joint agency.  We don't have access to the phenomenology of children.  I suppose we can reflect on our own experience of trying to do something together with children.  It does, I admit, seem one sided in some instances.  But here is a case I want the author to consider:  breastfeeding.  I think this is clearly a case of joint action.  The phenomenology of it is quite complex.  It clearly isn't a singular activity. Control is distributed.  And I guess I am not at all convinced that the intentions involved in social pretend play couldn't be socially extended in the way the author proposes. The phenomenology  of social play is really quite unified. When children are deeply involved in the play scenario there movements are very fluent.  I guess I just need more reasons for thinking it isn't possible. The author dismisses the possibility too quickly.  Here is a crazy idea that is worth considering---the intentions-in-action of infants are all socially extended and only as they develop into movers in the world do their intentions in action become individualized.  This is because infants don't have control over their bodily movements but are helped in various ways by adults--carried, moved, and so on.

The manuscript entitled "Socially extended intentions-in-action" investigates the nature of intentions that are involved in performing joint activities. It discusses accounts of joint intentions by Michael Bratman and by Deborah Tollefsen. According to the author (and other philosophers whom s/he refers to), both accounts are problematic in certain respects: On the one hand, Bratman's account of joint intentionality uses a planning notion of intentions which cannot account for joint actions performed by young children who do not yet possess full Theory of Mind capabilities. On the other hand, Tollefsen's account proposes a solution to Bratman's problem by referring to intentions-in-action (as introduced by John Searle) that do not require complex Theory of Mind abilities. However, by doing so, her account is in conflict with the widely accepted claim that intentions-in-action can only be about an individual's own actions, not about group actions (the author refers to this as the Solipsistic Constraint). After introducing these accounts and their related problems, the author proposes a solution by further adapting Tollefsen's account. In particular, s/he suggests that the Solipsistic Constraint should not be seen as an unconditional constraint on intentions-in-action. By first introducing the notion of technologically extended intentions-in-actions, the author demonstrates that intentions-in-action do not need to refer to basic body movements but can, given the right amount of skill, be extended to using a tool. Crucial here is the phenomenological aspect as the tool itself becomes "transparent". As a second step, s/he draws the analogy to socially extended intentions-in-action where individuals can have intentions-in-action about actions they perform together with others. In these cases, the movements performed by one's partner also become transparent such that it is valid to talk about an individual's intention to perform an action that requires coordination with another person's action. The author concludes that such socially extended intentions-in-action offer a solution to Tollefsen's conflict with the Solipsistic Constraint. However, due to the requirement of high proficiency in acting with a tool or with another person until transparency is achieved, the suggested account is, according to the author, still not suitable to account for joint activities as observed in young children, but only for a small subset of adult joint activities.

The topic of the present manuscript refers to an up-to-date discussion about the intentional structure needed for joint action and is, therefore, well suited for the interested readers of "The Review of Philosophy and Psychology". The manuscript itself is well-structured and follows a precise line of argumentation. The author's own analyses of present philosophical accounts as well as his/her own arguments are carefully formulated and seem plausible. 
However, as the paper addresses a difficult, rather abstract topic, I suggest the use of more examples and / or links to empirical work that would help to demonstrate the author's line of reasoning. Also a careful consideration of the complicated language style might be useful to increase readability (especially for the more experimentally working psychologists interested in RoPP). This concerns both the choice of words as well as how detailed each new aspect of the argument is explained. It would be unfortunate if the interesting ideas put forward in this manuscript could only be recognized by (philosophical) experts in the field of intentions. 
I recommend a publication of the manuscript in RoPP after minor revisions as listed below have been addressed. 

1)     Overall, the author has to check the text for word mistakes such as missing or extra words, wrong word order, inconsequent use of singular and plural within one sentence etc. Examples can already be found in the abstract, e.g., "two or more agents -to- engage", "each of them typically HAS a commitment", "IS unlikely TO be able to deal" etc, but extend throughout the whole text.
2)     The expression "joint activities where there is little room for personal-level deliberation and planning" is unclear without any examples of what such activities could be. Whereas some lack of clarity might be fine in the abstract, it would certainly be helpful if more information was provided on page 3 where this expression is mentioned in the text for the first time. Moreover, if this refers, as I understand it, to the type of highly skilled joint activity such as dancing, it remains unclear to me what "little room" means here. Compared to, for example, the quote on p. 22, that only says such joint activities "may not require" such deliberation, it is difficult to see why in these specific cases of joint activities personal-level deliberation and planning is not applicable.
3)     On page 2, references should be included in support of the claim that the SC is a "widely accepted constraint" (even though such references will also appear later on in the text (page 9)).
4)     On page 3, references to empirical evidence supporting the claim that infants and toddlers do not have a complex ToM would be good. 
5)     On page 4, a reference to Searle when first mentioning "Searlean intentions-in-actions" should be included.
6)     In Bratman's second condition on page 5, the "I" is certainly meant to be a "J".
7)     The second part of the third paragraph on page 5 appears to contain information that is probably true, but not relevant for the argument (and therefore confusing when trying to follow the line of argumentation). At this point, it is already clear that Bratman's account of intentions is about planning actions, not about actually performing them. What is the relevance of pointing out that this poses yet another problem to his account as it does not explain online coordination of real movements? If this point has relevance for the argument this needs to be spelled out in more detail as well as linked to the content of the following paragraph. 
8)     On page 6, beginning of the second paragraph, references to literature reporting empirical evidence for these developmental steps would be helpful, although I admit that also Tollefsen's original paper does not include any such references. 
9)     The sentence "The content that one accesses in one's experience of acting is the content of an action's intention-in-action, although one can intend-in-action without being conscious of acting" is not only rather difficult to understand, it also leaves the reader wondering in what situations one can have an intention about an action that one is not conscious of performing. Maybe this can be clarified?
10)     The expression "pace Bratman himself" (page 9, second part of the paragraph) seems to be rather unusual such that even a native speaker I asked had difficulties understanding the grammatical structure and content of the sentence. With respect to the international readership of RoPP, I suggest to avoid such expressions.
11)     On page 15, what does "a certain restriction" refer to? 
12)     On page 16, in the first line of the quote, a word seems to be missing: "to determine your --- by my actions".
13)     On page 19, last sentence, what aspect of Searle's theory of individual intention and action is referred to here? Is this about the causal link between intention-in-action and its content?
