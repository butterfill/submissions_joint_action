References to Bratman (1999) need to be replaced with references to the relevant papers as (1999) refers to a collection covering many topics.

Suggest cut footnote 2 on p. 4; this is telegraphic.  Also require cut footnote 3 on p. 5 as such a claim needs to be supported by substantial discussion.

p. 5, "the fact that they are not sophisticated 'mindreaders'" --- bring forward the citation of researchers making the opposite argument from p. 10; also include more recent work than Onishi & Baillargeon 2005; e.g. reference to Baillargeon et al 2010 "False Belief Understanding in Infants" would do.

p. 8 and elsewhere --- you describe Bratman's views using the term 'joint intention' whereas he uses the term 'shared intention'; unless there is a good reason, which I don't see, you should follow Bratman's own terminology.

p. 9 "I must intend that we go on a vacation together on the condition that you intend the same ..." --- this form of interdependence doesn't seem to follow from any of the clauses of Bratman's account and is problematic in itself (see Roth 2004).  Suggest cut (unless I'm wrong).

p. 11 fn. 11 --- "(this point is made by ...)": no need to acknowledge the unpublished paper 

p. 21.  There should be some reference to those who disagree with Maravita & Iriki's findings; their primary opponent is Charles Spence e.g.  Holmes Sanabria Calvert and Spence (2007) "tool-use: capturing multisensory spatial attention or extending multisensory peripersonal space".    It would also help to cite other work supporting Maravita & Iriki's finding, e.g. Farne Serino and Ladavas (2007) "Dynamic size-change of peri-hand space following tool-use: determinants and spatial characteristics revealed through cross-modal extinction" but this is optional.

p. 22 fn 19: This should be cited as "Pols (forthcoming)" and included in the reference list; also, do not translate the name of the university

p. 31: the final paragraph of Section 6 is hard to follow; suggest cut and but if you want to keep it please re-write paying attention to syntax and punctuation.

There are many typos (too many); please read this manuscript through carefully and correct.  Some of the typos I found include p. 3 fn. 1: "Bratman suggest" for "Bratman sugests" and "Kutz main point" for "Kutz' main point"; on p. 6, "Bratman's account face in" should be ""Bratman's account faces in"; p. 7 "Section 4 and 5" should be "Sections 4 and 5", p. 8 fn. 8; p. 13, "according Tollefsen" should be "according to Tollefsen", p. 14 fn. 14 the footnote symbol is in the wrong place; p. 15, "movement ... of one's own action" sounds wrong to my ear, suggest delete "movement or" from this and the preceding sentence; p. 21, "resources defines" should be "resources define"; p. 23 "were the phenomenon" for "was the phenomenon"; p. 25 "each skater cause" for "each skater causes"; p. 28 "an agent experience" for "an agent experiences" and also replace "his" with "his or her"; p. 29 "namely, the possibility ..." something has gone wrong with this clause's syntax; p. 29 "how an agent to" is wrong; p. 29 "delegate this control" for "delegating this control"; p. 29 "kids" for "children" (style!); p. 31 "Tollefsen even raise" for "Tollefsen even raises"
