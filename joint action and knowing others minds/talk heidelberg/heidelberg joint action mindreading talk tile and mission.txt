Mindreading and Joint Action

"The group consists of philosophers (both analytic and phenomenological) and psychologists, all interested in the Tom-debate and/or social interaction (here is the link to the not-so-up-to-date homepage of the project: http://www.rzuser.uni-heidelberg.de/~qy7/Index_engl.html) . Many of them know your dual-component-account of ToM and would be interested in hearing more about your thoughts on a minimal theory of mind (and, possibly, its relations to social interactions)."
